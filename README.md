Based on value histories of some stochastic process,the purpose is to make statements aboutthis process. For example, you want to estimate probabilities for a certain value, or range of values. It is necessary the modeling of the process. In this work the objectives are:

• Obtain a database of real sensors;

• Filter random variables from this database;

• Pre-process the data;

• Assuming a model, estimate the parameters associated with the model;
